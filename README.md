# Some directions because of Atom
Hi guys, I hope all of you are OK. I looks like the atom tool is giving you so much problems. So please try to do your essay document directly on your repository by ussing directly at [class-room web](http://classroom.github.com/), otherwise try it ussing [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). In case of you are ussing the GitHub Desktop don't forget to install [git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

Also don't be afraid we will see you on tuesday and we can solve a lot of your questions or doubts, but of course your essay should be almost finished. 

Good luck!

:)
